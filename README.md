# rpn-calculator
This project contains 2 calculators that implements the RPN algorithm. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). One of them is done with the message passing method based in RPC-SUN and the other is based in Apache-Thrift. They both support basic operations (sum, substract, multiplication and division) and some other more complex (power, square root, sin, cosin and tangent). Both have support to equations, vectorial and matrix operations and, like in any other calculator you can store 4 of them (to set a limit) and make modifications to them, operate with them... In both you can also decompose a number in prime numbers and make the module of a number.

The differences between both calculators are, first of all, that the one based in RPC-SUN, both server and client are only in C, and in the other, server and client are both in C++ and Python and they can communicate (C++ server - python client, python server - C++ client, C++ server - C++ client, python server - python client) and that the apache one implements more operations with real numbers (arcsin, arccos, arctan, absolute value and factorial), you can define and solve an equation system, you can find the determinant, inverse and transpose of a given matrix and there is support to changing between base-2, base-10 and base-16 numbers. There is also a error control in the second calculator to print errors in a more efficient way.
